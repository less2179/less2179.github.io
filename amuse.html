    <h1>Matt's Most Amusing Websites</h1>
    <h3>by Matthew Lessman</h3>
    <p>This website contains pages that an avid Nuggets fan, like myself, would enjoy keeping tabs on throughout the season!</p>

    <h2>MVP Race</h2>
    <p>The internet is always blooming with news about sports, and I am an avid Denver Nuggets fan. Recently, the Nuggets' center, Nikola Jokic, has won MVP in back to back seasons. To track his chances for a third, I have been looking at this website weekly.</p>

    <h2>Nuggets Fan Central</h2>
    <p>This page is central to all things Nuggets. It is a smaller business that is ran by Nuggets fans, for Nuggets fans. I often read articles from this page to remain updated on the most recent Nuggets news!</p>
    <a href="https://www.denverstiffs.com/">Denver Stiffs</a>

    <h2>The NBA Nuggets Page</h2>
    <p>As an organization, the NBA will almost always have the most information on one of the teams within the organization. While there is a lot of recent news about the Nuggets on the Denver Stiffs page, the NBA page itself offers more general information, such as the Nuggets' record; Nuggets tickets, Nuggets information, Nuggets roster, Nuggets merchandise, Nuggets highlights, and much more. As an avid Nuggets fan, even though it isn't a small business, it is still worth checking out the NBA's information on the team.</p>
